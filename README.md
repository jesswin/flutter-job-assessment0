This is a simple test which aims to demonstrate an ability to use Flutter with Firebase (Authentication, Storage, Cloud Functions and Firestore)  as well as an ability to write  a clean UI code in Flutter. Besides completing the task according to the set of instructions below, we are looking for well written code and a demonstration of understanding the best practices for state management using BLoC or providers.

Instructions
Build an authentication system using Firebase, with a pleasing Signup UI.
Authentication should be using email, phone number and Google/Facebook Auth.
Store other user details like age and birthdate in Firestore. All user details should be mapped through a user model.
For UI, build screens as shown in the image below. 
Store product in database, no need of a UI for that, you can simple enter the product details in the database, the main motive is to fetch the products from the database and show.
Build a cart system, add a product to cart from the above mentioned screen and store the cart in a global state.
Create your own git repository.
Push your code to your git repo to either github, bitbucket or gitlab.
